# Receipty
**Recipty** is a personal project for automated expense tracking based on shopping receipts.
The user sends a photo of a receipt, which is then processed to extract purchases, categorize expenses, generate visual statistics, and provide saving advice.
The project combines OCR, NLP, API development, and a data visualization dashboard.


## Current status

**Work in progress â€“ not finished yet** 

- Currently focusing on **data modeling, feature engineering, and analytics**.  
- Using **synthetic data generated with Faker** to build dashboards and validate pipelines.  
- Backend built with **FastAPI** and **Supabase**, with **structured data generation using Pydantic and LLMs** for automatic categorization of expenses.  
- Prototyping dashboards with **Streamlit**.  
- Development workflow includes **UV** as a modern package manager and **pre-commit hooks**, with plans to add **pytest** for testing.


## Next steps

- Integrate **OCR** later to process real receipt images...
