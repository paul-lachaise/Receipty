# Receipty
**Recipty** is a personal project for automated expense tracking based on shopping receipts.
The user sends a photo of a receipt, which is then processed to extract purchases, categorize expenses, generate visual statistics, and provide saving advice.
The project combines OCR, NLP, API development, and a data visualization dashboard.
